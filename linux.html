            The recent announcement of the Antergos operating system shutting down was sad. The operating system, based off of Arch Linux, was probably one of the best out there depending on who you ask. Antergosâ€™s announcement was hard on some people, and we will all miss it. As a community we cannot hold back the realization or knowledge that any of the operating systems we love and support might become obsolete in a day. That is the true problem with Linux and BSD, but at the same time good thing. All good things have to come to an end, and Antergos was one of many distributions that may shut down within the next few years. Goodbye Antergos.

            Pop!_OS is an beautiful distribution built off of Ubuntu by System76. Games run smooth, because the stuff the games need is up to date. It is best for programmers as everything is up to date. Pop!_OS is a growing OS for a reason. The operating system is my daily driver and I even wrote this article on Pop!_OS. Pop is where I do all of my programming, and it is also very easy to use. The GNOME desktop is really what sells it for me but of course it is easy to set up and use other desktop environments as well.          <ul>
            Pros
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>Up to date</li>
            <li>Great for kids and newbies</li><br>
            Cons
            <li>The main background is ugly, but that can be changed with ease</li>
            <li>More of a personal preference but Nautilus is not that great of a file manager</li>
            <li>Breaking things yourself will happen, I personally broke sudo commands</li>
          </ul>
