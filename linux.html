          </h1>
          <p>
            Pop!_OS is an beautiful distribution built off of Ubuntu by System76. Games run smooth, because the stuff the games need is up to date. It is best for programmers as everything is up to date. Pop!_OS is a growing OS for a reason. The operating system is my daily driver and I even wrote this article on Pop!_OS. Pop is where I do all of my programming, and it is also very easy to use. The GNOME desktop is really what sells it for me but of course it is easy to set up and use other desktop environments as well.          <ul>
            Pros

            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>Up to date</li>
            <li>Great for kids and newbies</li><br>
            Cons
            <li>The main background is ugly, but that can be changed with ease</li>
            <li>More of a personal preference but Nautilus is not that great of a file manager</li>
            <li>Breaking things yourself will happen, I personally broke sudo commands</li>
