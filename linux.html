          <h1>RareOS</h1>
          <h6>May 23, 2019</h6>
          <p>RareOS is a bad distribution of Linux software. It is not the worst but certainly no where close to good. I installed it twice and it still does not think it is installed. The operating system has Chromium built in instead of Firefox which angered me because if you want Chrome-like why not just use Chrome? Other than that there is no real anything to the operating system. Sure it is early access but everything about it just doesn’t matter. The devs need to figure out how to fix the installation and then and only then would I consider recommending this distribution to anyone.</p>

          <h1>Ubuntu 19.04</h1>
          <h6>May 23, 2019</h3>
          <p>Ubuntu 19.04 is one of the cleanest and nicest looking distributions I have ever seen. With the newest version of Bash, and more things up to date it has never been easier to use this distribution. The icons alone are beautiful, the system runs smooth except for a few minor hick-ups here and there. The hick-ups existing annoy me but they are so small that they are barely noticeable. The 19.04 update was probably the best for Ubuntu as it seems to have everything up to date. Is there beating it? Almost not at all. I can only think of two distributions that I would recommend above it. Those would be Pop!_OS because Pop!_Shop has much better and more up-to-date software than the Ubuntu Software Center and Elementary OS because it is far more beginner friendly. I would have to recommend Ubuntu 19.04 for most users if they are already thinking about downloading it. However if you need less bloatware which this distribution has a lot of, then I would recommend Pop!_OS.</p>

            The recent announcement of the Antergos operating system shutting down was sad. The operating system, based off of Arch Linux, was probably one of the best out there depending on who you ask. Antergos’s announcement was hard on some people, and we will all miss it. As a community we cannot hold back the realization or knowledge that any of the operating systems we love and support might become obsolete in a day. That is the true problem with Linux and BSD, but at the same time good thing. All good things have to come to an end, and Antergos was one of many distributions that may shut down within the next few years. Goodbye Antergos.

            Pop!_OS is an beautiful distribution built off of Ubuntu by System76. Games run smooth, because the stuff the games need is up to date. It is best for programmers as everything is up to date. Pop!_OS is a growing OS for a reason. The operating system is my daily driver and I even wrote this article on Pop!_OS. Pop is where I do all of my programming, and it is also very easy to use. The GNOME desktop is really what sells it for me but of course it is easy to set up and use other desktop environments as well.          <ul>
            Pros
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>Up to date</li>
            <li>Great for kids and newbies</li><br>
            Cons
            <li>The main background is ugly, but that can be changed with ease</li>
            <li>More of a personal preference but Nautilus is not that great of a file manager</li>
            <li>Breaking things yourself will happen, I personally broke sudo commands</li>
