        <p>OpenBSD is a good BSD distribution if you know what you are doing. Not for beginners at all. The setup to install is a pain, and there were many times I had to restart the installation. The regular terminal installer however is in fact the best way to go in this situation. While installing with graphics to hopefully make it faster, it did nothing and kept crashing my virtual machine. I never actually got to use much of the OS as I never figured out where or what I clicked to install a GUI but I did manage to earn the access of the terminal so I guess good enough. Personally I do not see why people like this BSD but it works, and if you know what to do you will have a much better time with it than I did. This was my first time using BSD and I am not impressed.
