        <h1>So few BSD's, only one works for me</h1>
        <h6>May 22, 2019</h6>
        <p>
          I am still testing BSD distributions like OpenBSD but each one breaks one way or another when trying to use it in a VM, and no duel-booting is not an option. The thing is that OpenBSD keeps repeating letters where I cannot type anything without breaking it. I can also not use Trident as it lags my computer using GNOME Boxes or any VM software I can get my hands on. For now reviews on BSD are completely impossible to do until I get a computer that won't break down in tears trying to install anything other than FreeBSD and maybe a few Linux distros. Linux is very much possible I just cannot do it today because my computer needs to rest in order to get anything done as keeping it on 24/7 does not make my computer happy. I will be back later today in the Linux area to share with you the many Linux things I can show you.

        <h1>FreeBSD</h1>

         <p> FreeBSD is easy to use but can take an hour to get things done. It took me an hour to install GNOME and all of the basic software. That was no fun, but it did start off in terminal which I felt like maybe a nice GUI would be better for screenshots. However it FreeBSD is secure and it being used for daily use probably was not what it is meant to do. Of course I got it all to work. Thanks to this video below I got it to work fine.</p><br>

<p>However I do have to say it can be a little slow. Or at least feel like it so what I did is I turned up the cursor speed and actually it works FINE and is much smoother. Now if you remembered your password for root access (I forgot mine) you can install EXTRA SOFTWARE! Now I tried to get Gimp, LibreOffice, and more but never got it. Yet you can also switch to GNOME3 classic which is what I did because I never saw it before.</p><br>
