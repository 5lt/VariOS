        <h1>FreeBSD</h1>

         <p> FreeBSD is easy to use but can take an hour to get things done. It took me an hour to install GNOME and all of the basic software. That was no fun, but it did start off in terminal which I felt like maybe a nice GUI would be better for screenshots. However it FreeBSD is secure and it being used for daily use probably was not what it is meant to do. Of course I got it all to work. Thanks to this video below I got it to work fine.</p><br>

<p>However I do have to say it can be a little slow. Or at least feel like it so what I did is I turned up the cursor speed and actually it works FINE and is much smoother. Now if you remembered your password for root access (I forgot mine) you can install EXTRA SOFTWARE! Now I tried to get Gimp, LibreOffice, and more but never got it. Yet you can also switch to GNOME3 classic which is what I did because I never saw it before.</p><br>
